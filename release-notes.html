<b>Version 4.14.1</b>
<ul>
<li> <a name="26654" href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26654" target="_blank">[Bug 26654]</a> quickMove shortcuts triggered during in-mail search</li>
<li> quickMove: Improve remembering all entered parent folders when only a single match is found.</li>
<li> Replaced className logic with classList, where possible</li>
<li> Removed deprecated getCharPref function: make remembering folder tabs preferences backwards compatible for older clients (Interlink) by using getComplexValue / getStringPref instead (getCharPref could lead to faulty characters when using extended character sets)</li>
<li> Japanese locale completed - thanks to Masahiko Imanaka. </li>
<li> Fixed: Message Navigation Buttons in Current Folder bar could not be hidden via options.</li>
<li> Prepared code base for compatibility with Thunderbird 66 - this will be released as a separate version because it is currently impossible to release a version that is compatible with Thunderbird 60. </li>
</ul>
